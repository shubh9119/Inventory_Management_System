## Usage

### Customer Features

Customers can interact with the system (if customer features are fully implemented) to browse products, place orders, and manage their profiles.

1. **Product Browsing:**
   - Customers can browse available products through the website's product catalog.
   - Products are typically categorized (e.g., by type, brand) for easy navigation.
   - A search functionality is usually provided to find specific products by name or keyword.

2. **Order Placement:**
   - After selecting desired products, customers can add them to their cart.
   - The cart displays the selected items and the total price.
   - Customers can proceed to checkout to place their order.  This usually involves providing shipping information and choosing a payment method.

3. **Order Tracking:**
   - After placing an order, customers can track its status (e.g., pending, processing, shipped, delivered) through the website or via email notifications.

4. **Profile Management:**
   - Customers can manage their profile information, including their name, contact details, shipping address, and order history.  They can also usually update their password.

**Example Customer Workflow:**

1. A customer visits the website and browses the product catalog.
