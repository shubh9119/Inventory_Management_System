## Introduction

This Inventory Management System is designed to streamline inventory tracking, sales management, and customer/retailer interactions. It provides a user-friendly interface for retailers to manage their products, track stock levels, generate bills and invoices, and analyze sales data.  Customers can view products, potentially place orders (depending on implementation), and manage their profiles.

* **Inventory Tracking:** Real-time tracking of stock levels, with alerts for low stock.
* **Customer Management:**  Manage customer information, including unique IDs, contact details, and purchase history.
* **Retailer Management:** Manage retailer information, including unique IDs, contact details.
* **Sales Management:** Record sales transactions, generate bills and invoices, and calculate sales revenue.
* **Reporting & Analytics:** Generate sales reports, analyze sales trends, and gain insights into inventory performance. (Mention specific reports if implemented, e.g., daily/weekly/monthly sales reports).
* **Billing & Invoicing:** Create and manage bills and invoices for customer purchases.
* **Customer Features:** (If implemented)
    * Product browsing and searching.
    * Order placement and tracking.
    * Profile management.
* **Retailer Features:**
    * Inventory management.
    * Sales transaction management.
    * Report generation.
    * Customer management.
    * Retailer management.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language.

* **Frontend:** ( e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a specific framework like React or Vue.js).
* **Other Libraries/Tools:** ( report generation libraries, payment gateways, etc.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`
2. **Create a virtual environment:** `python3 -m venv venv` (or `virtualenv venv`)
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all project dependencies.)
5. **Migrate database:** `python manage.py migrate`
6. **Run the development server:** `python manage.py runserver`
